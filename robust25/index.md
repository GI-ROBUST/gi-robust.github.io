This workshop is a joint technical discussion (“GI Fachgespräch”) of the [GI](https://gi.de) special interest groups on Communication and Distributed Systems ([KuVS](https://kuvs.de/)) and Operating Systems ([FGBS](https://www.betriebssysteme.org/)).
We look into protocols and frameworks that are robust against Byzantine faults.
The focus is on necessary concepts and infrastructure to enable (Byzantine) fault tolerance, but can also include the operation of such systems.
Selected areas in the field are given by the following, not necessarily complete, list:

* Agreement protocols (e.g., broadcast, consensus)
* State machine replication and other replication protocols
* Checkpointing, recovery, and reconfiguration protocols
* Frameworks for aforementioned protocols
* Hybrid fault models


<!--
* System support for blockchain
* System support for resource-limited devices and blockchain
* Resilient agreement protocols
* Trusted execution for improved resilience of decentralized infrastructures
* Blockchain consistency
* Cryptocurrency attacks and incentives
* Smart contract performance and security
* Blockchain soft and hard forks
* Anonymity and confidentiality in distributed ledgers
* Governance of distributed ledgers
* Scalability of distributed ledgers
* Use cases
* Novel application scenarios -->


### Call for Contributions

We look for presentations on your work, including preliminary results and open questions.
We plan with presentations of about 25min length joined by 15min of discussion, so that there is plenty of time for a substantial exchange.

If you want to give a presentation, please submit an abstract describing your talk before the deadline.
We accept up to two pages in the Lecture Notes on Informatics (LNI) format ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lni), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-lecture-notes-in-informatics-lni-manuscripts/hydnrjckjwrp)), including bibliography.
Submissions are not blind.
We recommend English submissions and English presentations, as far as possible.
Accepted submissions will be made available in public on the workshop website, but would not be part of official proceedings.
Submissions have to be sent to the following email address:
