This workshop is a joint Fachgespräch of the GI special interest groups on Communication and Distributed Systems (KuVS) and Operating Systems (FGBS).
Topics of interest are Byzantine fault tolerance and state-machine replication.
The focus is on necessary concepts and infrastructure to enable (Byzantine) fault tolerance, but can also include the operation of such systems.
Selected areas in the field are given by the following, not necessarily complete, list:


* Consensus and replication protocols
* Frameworks
* Checkpointing concepts
* Deterministic execution
* Group and deployment management
* Proactive recovery
* Hybrid fault models

<!-- * System support for blockchain
* System support for resource-limited devices and blockchain
* Resilient agreement protocols
* Trusted execution for improved resilience of decentralized infrastructures
* Blockchain consistency
* Cryptocurrency attacks and incentives
* Smart contract performance and security
* Blockchain soft and hard forks
* Anonymity and confidentiality in distributed ledgers
* Governance of distributed ledgers
* Scalability of distributed ledgers
* Use cases
* Novel application scenarios -->


### Call for Contributions

We look for presentations on your work, including preliminary results and open questions.
We plan with presentations of about 25min length joined by 15min of discussion, so that there is plenty of time for a substantial exchange.
