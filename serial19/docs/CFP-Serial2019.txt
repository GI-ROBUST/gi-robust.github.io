SERIAL – 3rd Workshop on Scalable and 
Resilient Infrastructures for Distributed Ledgers

https://serial.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/serial19

Colocated with Middleware 2019
December 9-13th 2019 – UC Davis, CA, USA

CALL FOR PAPERS

With the rise of digital currencies and distributed ledger
infrastructures, a multitude of novel application scenarios are currently
being discussed and evaluated. In essence, these technologies promise
to crosscut and change a large variety of digital interactions. At the
same time, the underlying infrastructures supporting these technologies
are rapidly being developed and deployed, and their resilience and
scalability is key for success.

The already 3rd SERIAL workshop, once again colocated with the Middleware
conference, continues the successful series of scientific forums
addressing the above themes. It aims to investigate system support to
foster resilience and scalability of decentralized infrastructures such
as distributed ledger ecosystems, but also addresses resilience support
for more traditional Internet-based services.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

 * System support for blockchains
 * System support for resource-limited devices and blockchains
 * Resilient agreement protocols
 * Trusted execution for improved resilience of decentralized infrastructures
 * Blockchain consistency
 * Cryptocurrency attacks and incentives
 * Smart contract performance and security
 * Blockchain soft and hard forks
 * Anonymity and confidentiality in distributed ledgers
 * Governance of distributed ledgers
 * Scalability of distributed ledgers

The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration and discussion among
researchers and practitioners in this field. The workshop will be one
full day. The program should primarily include presentations by authors
of accepted papers (the workshop will have proceedings in the ACM digital
library). Other elements will be one or two invited presentations and
a panel ending the day with an open discussion with the workshop audience.

IMPORTANT DATES (GMT/UTC-12)

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

SERIAL welcomes submissions in two formats:

Regular research papers of at most 6 pages including references. Research
papers should present work that has not been previously published
or concurrently submitted elsewhere, and will be published in the
proceedings.  Short research statements of at most 2 pages. Research
statements aim at fostering discussion and collaboration. They
may summarize research published elsewhere or outline new emerging
ideas. Authors can choose if accepted research statements should appear
in the proceedings

Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM
SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the ACM template page. Authors are
further strongly encouraged to use a 10pt font instead of 9pt one.

Submissions should be in PDF and entered on the submission page: 
https://serial19.hotcrp.com/paper/new

Reviewing is single blind. This means that the names and affiliations of
the authors must appear in the submitted papers. Each paper will receive
at least three reviews from members of the program committee. Submissions
that do not respect the formatting requirements may be rejected without
review.
