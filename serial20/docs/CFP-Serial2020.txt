SERIAL – 4th Workshop on Scalable and 
Resilient Infrastructures for Distributed Ledgers

https://serial.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/serial20

Colocated with Middleware 2020
December 7-11th 2020 – TU Delft, The Netherlands
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CALL FOR PAPERS

With the rise of digital currencies and distributed ledger
infrastructures, a multitude of novel application scenarios are currently
being discussed and evaluated. In essence, these technologies promise
to crosscut and change a large variety of digital interactions. At the
same time, the underlying infrastructures supporting these technologies
are rapidly being developed and deployed, and their resilience and
scalability is key for success.

The already 4th SERIAL workshop, once again colocated with the Middleware
conference, continues the successful series of scientific forums
addressing the above themes. It aims to investigate system support to
foster resilience and scalability of decentralized infrastructures such
as distributed ledger ecosystems, but also addresses resilience support
for more traditional Internet-based services.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

 * System support for blockchains
 * System support for resource-limited devices and blockchains
 * Resilient agreement protocols
 * Trusted execution for improved resilience of decentralized infrastructures
 * Blockchain consistency
 * Cryptocurrency attacks and incentives
 * Smart contract performance and security
 * Blockchain soft and hard forks
 * Anonymity and confidentiality in distributed ledgers
 * Governance of distributed ledgers
 * Scalability of distributed ledgers

The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration and discussion among
researchers and practitioners in this field. The workshop will be one
full day. The program should primarily include presentations by authors
of accepted papers (the workshop will have proceedings in the ACM digital
library). Other elements will be one or two invited presentations and
a panel ending the day with an open discussion with the workshop audience.

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

We welcome submissions in two formats:
 - Regular research papers: at most 4 pages including references
   (previously unpublished work, will be published in proceedings) 
 - Extended abstract: Position Papers, Controversial Ideas and Summary of
   already published work. 1-2 pages including references
   (will *not* be published in proceedings but will be presented during
   the workshop)

Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM
SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the ACM template page. Authors are
further strongly encouraged to use a 10pt font instead of 9pt one.

Submissions should be in PDF and entered on the submission page: 
https://serial20.hotcrp.com/paper/new

Reviewing is single blind. This means that the names and affiliations of
the authors must appear in the submitted papers. Each paper will receive
at least three reviews from members of the program committee. Submissions
that do not respect the formatting requirements may be rejected without
review.
