<!-- ### About the Workshop

With the rise of digital currencies and distributed ledger infrastructures, a multitude of novel application scenarios are currently being discussed and evaluated. In essence, these technologies promise to crosscut and change a large variety of digital interactions. At the same time, the underlying infrastructures supporting these technologies are rapidly being developed and deployed, and their resilience and scalability is key to success.

After one year break, due to the pandemic, the 5th SERIAL workshop hopes to continue the successful series of scientific forums addressing the above themes. It aims to investigate system support to foster resilience and scalability of decentralized infrastructures such as distributed ledger ecosystems, but also addresses resilience support for more traditional Internet-based services.

To facilitate a discussion on the maturity of existing infrastructure, we want to especially invite works exploring novel use cases and application scenarios of distributed ledger infrastructure and their requirements. Besides well established use cases like decentralized finance and supply chain management we especially welcome applications to novel domains like education, social networks and cloud storage.

### Call for Papers

#### Topics

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* System support for blockchain
* System support for resource-limited devices and blockchain
* Resilient agreement protocols
* Trusted execution for improved resilience of decentralized infrastructures 
* Blockchain consistency
* Cryptocurrency attacks and incentives
* Smart contract performance and security
* Blockchain soft and hard forks
* Anonymity and confidentiality in distributed ledgers
* Governance of distributed ledgers
* Scalability of distributed ledgers
* Use cases
* Novel application scenarios

The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration and discussion among researchers and practitioners in this field. The workshop will be one full day. The program should primarily include presentations by authors of accepted papers (the workshop will have proceedings in the ACM digital library). Other elements will be one or two invited presentations and a panel ending the day with an open discussion with the workshop audience.

#### Submission Guidelines

SERIAL welcomes submissions in two formats:
* Regular paper of at most 6 pages, including references. Research papers should
present work that has not been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere and will be published in the proceedings.
* Short research statements or position papers of at most 2 pages. Research
statements aim at fostering discussion and collaboration. They may summarize research published elsewhere or outline new emerging ideas. Research statements will not be published in the proceedings.

Reviewing is single-blind. This means that the names and affiliations of the authors must appear in the submitted papers. Each paper will receive at least three reviews from members of the program committee.

#### Important dates

We aim to follow the schedule proposed by middleware for research papers to be published in proceedings. Since position papers do not require a camera-ready, we aim for a later deadline, to allow fresh ideas to be proposed

* Research paper submission: 31 August 2022
* Research paper notification: 23 September 2022
* Camera-ready due: 3 October 2022
* Position paper submission: 30 September 2022
* Position paper notification: 14 October 2022
