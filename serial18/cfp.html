      <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
       <h4><a href="./docs/CFP-Serial2018.txt">Text-only version of the CFP</a></h4>

       <p>With the rise of digital currencies and distributed ledger infrastructures, a multitude of novel application scenarios are currently discussed and evaluated. In essence, these technologies will crosscut and change a large variety of digital interactions. At the same time, the underlying infrastructures are rapidly developed and deployed. Thereby, their resilience and scalability is key for success. </p>
       <p>The 2nd Workshop for Scalable Resilient Infrastructures targets to investigate system support to
foster resilience and scalability of decentralized infrastructures such as distributed ledger
ecosystems but also addresses resilience support for more traditional Internet-based services.</p>

      <p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>System support for blockchain</li>
        <li>System support for resource-limited devices and blockchain</li>
        <li>Resilient agreement protocols </li>
        <li>Trusted execution for improved resilience of decentralized infrastructures</li>
        <li>Blockchain consistency</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrency attacks and incentives</li>
        <li>Smart contract performance and security</li>
        <li>Blockchain soft and hard forks</li>
        <li>Anonymity and confidentiality in distributed ledgers</li>
        <li>Governance of distributed ledgers</li>
        <li>Scalability of distributed ledgers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Format of the workshop</h3>
      <p>The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration and discussion among researchers and
practitioners in this field. The workshop will be one full day. The program should primarily include
presentations by authors of accepted papers (the workshop will have proceedings in the ACM
digital library). Other elements will be one or two invited presentations and a panel ending the day
with an open discussion with the workshop audience.</p>

      <h3>Important dates</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><strike> September 7, 2018 </strike> - Paper submission</li>
         <li><strong>NEW: October 1, 2018</strong> - Notification of acceptance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Submission Guidelines </h3>
<p>SERIAL welcomes submissions in two formats:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Regular research papers of at most 6 pages</strong> including references. Research papers should be work that is not previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere and will be published in the proceedings.</li>
	<li><strong>Short research statements of at most 1-2 pages.</strong> Research statements aim at fostering discussion and collaboration. Research statements may summarize research published elsewhere or outline new emerging ideas. Authors can <strong>choose</strong> if accepted research statements should be published in the proceedings.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>All submissions should be in PDF and must follow the ACM SIGPLAN format (<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>).</p>

<p>Reviewing is single-blind. This means that the names and affiliations of the authors must appear in the submitted papers. Each paper will receive at least three reviews from members of the program committee. Submissions that do not respect the formatting requirement may be rejected without review.</p>
